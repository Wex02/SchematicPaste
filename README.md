# SchematicPaste
 Schematic pasting without WorldEdit API
 Written for Bukkit/Spigot/Paper Servers running 1.16.5
 
 ## Why?
 The WorldEdit API must have the WorlEdit plugin running but i only wanted to use the schematic pasting part of it so i written this small plugin just for that.
 Only using NMS and the Bukkit API (Paper)
 This just loads the schematic file and builds it at the given location.

Only works with schem file structured like this:
